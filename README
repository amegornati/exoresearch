## Project Objective

This repository is my personal starting point in building toward Exomind research — the long-term pursuit of understanding and eventually digitizing aspects of human cognition and identity. Right now, the focus is narrow and practical:  
- Learn how to record and process non-invasive EEG data  
- Implement a simple SSVEP (steady-state visual evoked potential) demo with real-time decoding  
- Establish a **weekly identity-probe routine** that could, one day, scale into more advanced models of cognition

I’m an undergraduate researcher at the University at Albany, with parallel experience in quantum photonics and exploratory work in AI/ML (Computer Vision-focus) lab. This repo is a personal training ground — not a finished product, but a foundation.

## Quick Start

### Create environment (venv recommended)
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

---

**No-hardware demo**

Open three terminals (with .venv active):

Terminal A: synthetic EEG stream

python code\sim_ssvep_lsl.py


Terminal B: flicker stimulus + markers

python -m stim.ssvep_stim


Terminal C: real-time decoder

python -m code.rt_ssvep_online


Expected: Terminal C prints live “Decision: A | B | C | D…” while Terminal B shows flickering squares.

Repository Layout
code/        # decoders, simulators, loaders
stim/        # stimulus presentation + LSL markers
utils/       # lightweight helper modules (LSL, etc.)
config/      # runtime config (frequencies, channels)
data/raw/    # raw recordings (.xdf, .edf, .gdf) [gitignored]
data/deriv/  # derived outputs (fif/csv/plots)
notebooks/   # analysis notebooks (weekly probe, offline analysis)
docs/        # how-tos (LabRecorder, data handling)
